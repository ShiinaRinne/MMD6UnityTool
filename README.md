<!-- ## Known Issue -->

## Usage

- **For camera animation**, just right click on VMD file and select `MMD/Create Camera Anim`<br>
  Based on the structure of anim, you need to create two empty objects in the scene as follows,
  and rename the middle object to `Distance.`

- **For morph animation**, you need to select the object in the scene that contains the blendshapes of the face under the
  model
  (If it is generated by MMD4Mecanim, it is usually `your model/U_Char/U_Char_1`)<br>
  and select the VMD with morph (ie: multi selection)<br>
  ![](pic/morph.png) <br>
  Then right click and select `MMD/Create Morph Anim`

- When you use camera animation via Timeline, please uncheck `Remove Start Offset` in Clip properties<br>
